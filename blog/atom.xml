      <![CDATA[<p>I started writing this site a few days ago, my first blog post was published online around June 28th. But now I've gotten up to about 8 posts, almost enough for a full-fledged blog site, so I figure it's time to make all of them organized and accessible from the get go. For right now, and maybe forever, I decided to make the most recent blog post this index post so it shows up on the homepage. Here are the other posts I've got on the site:</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is less of a blog post and more of a photo collection of pretty drives, skies, and landscapes I collected during my time in the Pacific Northwest. Unlike most of my blog posts, the pictures here are presented chronologically.</p>
<p>I flew from Las Vegas to Seattle on March 10th, 2019 - one day before starting work. Here's the first pic I captured of Washington, a shot of Rainier taken somewhere above Elk Plain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2019_rainier_plane.jpg" alt="Rainier from a Plane" title="rainier from a plane" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Soon after getting to Washington, I made a trip up to Vancouver.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2019_vancouver.jpg" alt="Vancouver" title="Vancouver" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In July, I got another pic of Rainier - this time from Rainier Vista Park in the middle of UW, while playing frisbee and doing cheer pyramids with some friends.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/july_2019_uw_rainier.jpg" alt="Rainier from UW" title="rainier from UW" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>The only other pic I have from 2019 is a pic of the sky taken from my office in november, when the sun was setting a couple hours before I'd leave for home. I took this exactly a year after my interview for the position, the first time I had ever seen Seattle!</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2019_work.jpg" alt="Work Sky" title="work sky" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Now on to 2020, the only full year I've lived in Seattle! The first three months were spent working a fairly busy schedule, I barely saw any sunlight and have no pictures from that period. The next six months after that were spent alone in my apartment for the most part. In June, I was living in Capitol Hill, Seattle a block away from the SPD East Precinct. These are a few pics from June 1st around my neighborhood</p>

<p>June 2nd, 2020 was the first time I personally experienced agents of the US state deploy flashbangs, pepper spray, and teargas on civilians. Over the course of the next weeks, I took a few photos of what I saw from my roof and from the ground.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_protest_roof.jpg" alt="june_2020_protest_roof" title="june_2020_protest_roof" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_precinct.jpg" alt="june_2020_precinct" title="june_2020_precinct" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>June was also when I started seeing people outdoors again, and I caught a couple fun pics of seattle and cranes while I was out fishing with three of my buds.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_fishing.jpg" alt="june_2020_fishing" title="june_2020_fishing" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_fishing_cranes.jpg" alt="june_2020_fishing_cranes" title="june_2020_fishing_cranes" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>After spending March-August alone in Cap Hill, I moved into an Idahoan airbnb with friends in September. Here's a pic going from Clark Fork back to Bonners Ferry after a day of hiking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/sept_2020_idaho_drive.jpg" alt="sept_2020_idaho_drive" title="sept_2020_idaho_drive" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In October, I moved back to Kirkland, WA with the bulk of that group. Here are some pics of the beautiful trees in our neighborhood that fall.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/oct_2020_storms.jpg" alt="oct_2020_storms" title="oct_2020_storms" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/oct_2020_clouds.jpg" alt="oct_2020_clouds" title="oct_2020_clouds" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_room.jpg" alt="nov_2020_room" title="nov_2020_room" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Right near our house was Juanita Beach, and we made good use of the fresh air and scenery while confined to mostly outdoor activities. Here's one of my roommates standing at the dock near sunset.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_ariana_juanita.jpg" alt="nov_2020_ariana_juanita" title="nov_2020_ariana_juanita" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>That same november I drove down to California to spend some time with family over Thanksgiving. Here are a couple pics driving down from Sacramento </p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise.jpg" alt="nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise" title="nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_sunrise.jpg" alt="nov_2020_sunrise" title="nov_2020_sunrise" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>and one driving back up in Oregon</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_oregon.jpg" alt="nov_2020_oregon" title="nov_2020_oregon" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Which leaves us with our last picture of 2020, a photo from my room showcasing stormy yet sunny skies and some (still all working!) string lights.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/dec_2020_room.jpg" alt="dec_2020_room" title="dec_2020_room" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I don't have too many skyline photos from the first half of 2021 but I did capture some of the snow that covered our neighborhood in February</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/feb_2021_snowy.jpg" alt="feb_2021_snowy" title="feb_2021_snowy" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/feb_2021_snowy_street.jpg" alt="feb_2021_snowy_street" title="feb_2021_snowy_street" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Later, in March, someone else took this pic of me walking to the Marymoor climbing wall. I left this one till the very end, not only because chronological order dictates I put it here, but also because it's better than a lot of my own photos. My only solace is knowing that the picture just wouldn't be the same without me in it, and thus it would've been nigh impossible for me to take.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2021_marymoor.jpg" alt="mar_2021_marymoor" title="mar_2021_marymoor" width="2560" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In June, my last month in Seattle (this time around), I took a skyline pic in Belltown</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_belltown.jpg" alt="june_2021_belltown" title="june_2021_belltown" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>and I remembered to grab one of the pink and blue sky in Marymoor as well.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_drivein.jpg" alt="june_2021_drivein" title="june_2021_drivein" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I ended my time in Kirkland by driving out, headed (indirectly) to Virginia. As such, I think it's fitting ending this post with a photo I took headed from Washington to San Francisco, the last time I was in the Pacific Northwest and the first leg of my journey east!</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_seattle_to_sf.jpg" alt="june_2021_seattle_to_sf" title="june_2021_seattle_to_sf" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>]]>
