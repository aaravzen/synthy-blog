## What's up?

Currently I'm working on building/developing musical instruments and studying the materialist conception of history full-time. In my spare time, I try my hand at woodworking, electronics, music, cooking, and many other short-lived but fondly-remembered hobbies.

I'm currently in the process of moving from Seattle back to Virginia.

### Professional Experience, mostly in Seattle and NYC

I was last a software developer (aka `networking engineer`) at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on [Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/) in Redmond, WA.

In 2017 and 2018, I spent time interning at [Bloomberg, LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/). I built software to incorporate open orders in cash blotters for [Asset and Investment Manager](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/) (buy-side tool suite) during my first year there. My second year, I switched over to sell-side tools as I worked on the [Salesperson Dashboard (DASH)](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/salesperson-dashboard/); here, I built a [FIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange) message sender and simulator for internal development testing, beta production testing, and external sales demonstrations of our application suite workflows. I also won a fun [overnight puzzle challenge](https://vimeo.com/242652952) during my time there, s/o Mikey Mike and the Bloomberg Bunch!

### Education and Academic Hobbies, back in Blacksburg

I got a couple B.Sc.s from [Virginia Tech](vt.edu) in math and computer science in 2018.

I've spent time helping out at [VTHacks](https://vthacks.com/) (PR and organizing for the event) and [VTHunt](https://www.vthunt.com/) (making the site for the puzzle hunt).

I was also a member of the [VT Programming Team](https://icpc.cs.vt.edu/#/). We competed in the [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/), training under [Dr. Godmar Back](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gback/). I competed in the [2017 Mid-Atlantic ICPC Regional](https://mausa17.kattis.com/standings) on team WorstSort (we finished #7/170). In the [2018 Mid-Atlantic ICPC Regional](https://mausa18.kattis.com/standings), I was a member of the Classy Coders (we finished #11/185). I was also a [Bloomberg CodeCon](https://codecon.bloomberg.com/) World Finalist in 2019.

In the offseason, I was briefly President of the [VT Programming Team Offseason](https://gobblerconnect.vt.edu/organization/ProgrammingTeam). Along with being the de facto pizza orderer, I gave some lectures on concepts like [Greedy Algorithms](http://bit.ly/2sAlomU), [Dynamic Programming](http://bit.ly/2G8q1KH), [Backtracking Algorithms](http://bit.ly/2nRbnfJ), and [Sliding Window/Line Sweep Algorithms](https://bit.ly/2Gg11xX).

I also enjoy writing programming problems when I get the opportunity. I've written for [Virginia Tech's High School Programming Contest](https://icpc.cs.vt.edu/#/hscontest) a couple times:  
   [Provinces and Gold](https://open.kattis.com/problems/provincesandgold) is a fairly trivial problem based on [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game))  
   [Substitution Mania!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/substitutionmania) is a tricky optimization problem - if you do (or don't) solve this one (or any one, really) and want to talk about it, feel free to reach out to me! I love talking about these problems.

I've also written some on the VT [Practice Site](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/). Feel free to go through [my submissions](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/users/aarav) to collect em all and critique my code, but here are a few I could find:  
   [Lowest Factor Sum](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/286)  
   [Rubber Band](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/285)  
   [Rubber Band (easy version, in case that first one stumps ya)](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/284)  
   [Maximal Substring with N repeated characters](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/288)  
   [Find the Apple](https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/273)  

I also tutored math and physics (calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, number theory, mechanics) and spent ample time in the Systems Lounge down in the basement of McBryde.

### The Formative Years, at home in Richmond, VA

I graduated from [Maggie L. Walker Governor's School](http://www.gsgis.k12.va.us/) in 2015.

I spent most of my time in high school dedicated working with my robotics team, the [Mech Tech Dragons](http://mechtechdragons.com/). I was the Team Captain (CEO) my senior year and served as the Build Captain (CTO) my junior year. I won the [Dean's List Finalist Award](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/422/2014) during my tenure there and I'm proud to have helped shape the team with some of the most meaningful work I've done.

I worked as a teacher and camp counselor at [Engineering for Kids](https://www.engineeringforkids.com/) for a few years. I really enjoy working with kids, and this opportunity was a great chance to develop my ability to communicate and handle overwhelming classroom situations.

I was a research assistant at [Dr. Karla Mossi](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/karlamossi/)'s [Smart Materials Lab](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~kmmossi/index.htm) at VCU. I helped her and Dr. Ugur Erturun during their research collection and editing phases of their paper [Thermoelectric Devices with Rotated and Coaxial Leg Configurations: Numerical Analysis of Performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359431115003294).
