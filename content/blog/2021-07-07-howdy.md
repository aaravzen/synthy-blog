I started writing this site a few days ago, my first blog post was published online around June 28th. But now I've gotten up to about 8 posts, almost enough for a full-fledged blog site, so I figure it's time to make all of them organized and accessible from the get go. For right now, and maybe forever, I decided to make the most recent blog post this index post so it shows up on the homepage. Here are the other posts I've got on the site:

### The Aarav Syngth Experience updates:
