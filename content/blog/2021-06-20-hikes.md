Hiking isn't my calling, it's definitely not one of my most time-consuming hobbies, but it's so conducive to picture taking that even a few good hikes make for a good blog post. I'd have been remiss to have missed em during my time in Seattle

These photos start off with a trip to Bandera Mountain with my friends Ariana, Chris, and Peter in June of 2020.

Last September we also hiked Scotchman Peak in Idaho

and we stopped by the Columbia River near Echo Basin in Quincy, WA on the way back to Seattle.

In October, some of us went to Annette Lake

where Chris got dangerously close to falling into the water

success!

In March, I got this pic of the six of us at Douglas Fir

![march_six_douglar_fir.jpeg](/images/hikes/march_six_douglar_fir.jpeg?resize=1200 'march_six_douglar_fir.jpeg')

and later in June I saw many baby squirrels at Rattlesnake Ledge with Christy

Although it would've been ideal to end on something more impressive like Mount Rainier, something that my friends Peter and Chris would summit just a couple weeks after I left Kirkland, I did manage to hike Mailbox as a fairly challenging finishing feat. It starts in the trees

and eventually you gotta climb up a buncha rocks

![june_2021_mailbox_rocks.jpeg](/images/hikes/june_2021_mailbox_rocks.jpeg?resize=1200 'june_2021_mailbox_rocks.jpeg')

Then you get to the Area of Goats

![june_2021_mailbox_goat.jpeg](/images/hikes/june_2021_mailbox_goat.jpeg?resize=1200 'june_2021_mailbox_goat.jpeg')

as you close in on the summit!

While you're there, you get beautiful views of all around the valley

![june_2021_mailbox_view.jpeg](/images/hikes/june_2021_mailbox_view.jpeg?resize=1200 'june_2021_mailbox_view.jpeg')

including a straight sight at Rainier
