I started indoor bouldering sometime around 2016 with friends at Virginia Tech. I continued with that a bit in 2017 and 2018 while I was in New York and Blacksburg. Back before the pandemic hit, I was trying to get consistent about going to Stone Gardens after work at least once a week.

In the last couple years I've also made an effort to go outdoor climbing (although external motivation was a key factor there for sure). Back in the summer of 2019, my bud Brian got me to go with him to Gold Bar when he visited town

These climbs were difficult. Here's Brian trying to show me how to get off of the ground

The next climbing experience I've got photographed is one of the first post-covid interactions I had with people I knew. Before moving in with them later in the year, I started hanging out with my friends Peter and Ariana and we went climbing near Dirty Harry's Balcony.

Here's me up on a climb

looking down at Peter and Ariana

and all the trees around.

and here's Ariana belaying Peter so he could set up a climb

We moved into Kirkland in October so the weather wasn't great for climbing outdoors for a bit, but I got ample opportunity to visit Marymoor Park's climbing wall from March through June. Here are some photos from March and April

Here's me sitting in a cubby getting a shot of Peter below

Here's another I got of Ariana belaying Christy,

and one of Peter at the top of the spire!

I've thrown this picture into another post before ([skies](https://syngths.xyz/blog/skies/)) but it's a cool shot so here it is again
