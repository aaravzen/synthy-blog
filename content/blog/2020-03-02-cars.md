This post is dated back to March 2020 but, full disclosure, this is being written in July 2021 with a whole year and three months of extra reflection and wisdom.

My friend Trevor's kids shared some of their matchbox cars with me, so I figured I'd take some shots of them and send em back. Most of these were taken around January 2020, and I didn't think too much of it at the time, but the most recent picture (the only one not taken in my old apartment) is the last picture I've got from my old office.

I stopped working at Microsoft late in the winter of 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and the height of working from home, but my last day in the office was March 2nd, 2020. I didn't expect to never return - I'm pretty sure I took the picture because I wasn't sure whether or not to take my plants home to water (I didn't take them home; I can only assume they've moved on to a better place. sorry plants).

Having left the job and the Seattle area, the picture is a nice reminder of an era passed by. The pandemic and my experiences through it have shaped my ideology and perspective significantly; I'll never be quite the same person I was taking these pictures, and it's a bit wistful feeling the lack of resolution characteristic of the last year.

Many things have changed and I've left many of my old thoughts and feelings abandoned in 2020. Nature is a state of continuous motion and change, time flows only towards increasing entropy. Mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; may we work diligently on the tasks ahead.

bonus pic of a car watching cars lol
