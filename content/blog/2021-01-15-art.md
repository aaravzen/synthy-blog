My site (and interests) largely focus on musical artistry and engineering, but I also enjoy creating physical pieces of art when I get the chance. Although I've tried to improve my sketching and drawing over the years, the work I'm proud of tends to be more three dimensional; I like building stuff!

I made a couple pieces of art focused on Seattle a few years ago for a couple friends moving out there. One's a map of the city while the other's a skyline view, both made using wood, brads (tiny nails), and yarn.

If I ever find a picture of the finished thing I'll update that one, whoops on that documentation oversight.

I also made a similar wood block using a guitar string instead of yarn (and this time properly finishing the wood lol) this past winter.

Here are a couple bonus pics of me in front of the art and a couple trees me and my friend Christy worked on
