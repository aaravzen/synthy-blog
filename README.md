This is a general purpose site following the musical instrument building and other endeavors I've been pursuing the past couple years. Right now it's mostly a blog for recordkeeping. The site is available [here](https://syngths.xyz)

Please visit the [main project directory](https://github.com/aaravzen/Synthy) if you're looking for code related to the synth.
