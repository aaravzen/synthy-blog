      <![CDATA[<p>I started writing this site a few days ago, my first blog post was published online around June 28th. But now I've gotten up to about 8 posts, almost enough for a full-fledged blog site, so I figure it's time to make all of them organized and accessible from the get go. For right now, and maybe forever, I decided to make the most recent blog post this index post so it shows up on the homepage. Here are the other posts I've got on the site:</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is less of a blog post and more of a photo collection of pretty drives, skies, and landscapes I collected during my time in the Pacific Northwest. Unlike most of my blog posts, the pictures here are presented chronologically.</p>
<p>I flew from Las Vegas to Seattle on March 10th, 2019 - one day before starting work. Here's the first pic I captured of Washington, a shot of Rainier taken somewhere above Elk Plain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2019_rainier_plane.jpg" alt="Rainier from a Plane" title="rainier from a plane" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Soon after getting to Washington, I made a trip up to Vancouver.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2019_vancouver.jpg" alt="Vancouver" title="Vancouver" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In July, I got another pic of Rainier - this time from Rainier Vista Park in the middle of UW, while playing frisbee and doing cheer pyramids with some friends.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/july_2019_uw_rainier.jpg" alt="Rainier from UW" title="rainier from UW" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>The only other pic I have from 2019 is a pic of the sky taken from my office in november, when the sun was setting a couple hours before I'd leave for home. I took this exactly a year after my interview for the position, the first time I had ever seen Seattle!</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2019_work.jpg" alt="Work Sky" title="work sky" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Now on to 2020, the only full year I've lived in Seattle! The first three months were spent working a fairly busy schedule, I barely saw any sunlight and have no pictures from that period. The next six months after that were spent alone in my apartment for the most part. In June, I was living in Capitol Hill, Seattle a block away from the SPD East Precinct. These are a few pics from June 1st around my neighborhood</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_crane_moon_rainier.jpg" alt="june_2020_crane_moon_rainier" title="june_2020_crane_moon_rainier" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_crane_sky.jpg" alt="june_2020_crane_sky" title="june_2020_crane_sky" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_kurt.jpg" alt="june_2020_kurt" title="june_2020_kurt" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_neighborhood.jpg" alt="june_2020_neighborhood" title="june_2020_neighborhood" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>June 2nd, 2020 was the first time I personally experienced agents of the US state deploy flashbangs, pepper spray, and teargas on civilians. Over the course of the next weeks, I took a few photos of what I saw from my roof and from the ground.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_protest_roof.jpg" alt="june_2020_protest_roof" title="june_2020_protest_roof" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_precinct.jpg" alt="june_2020_precinct" title="june_2020_precinct" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>June was also when I started seeing people outdoors again, and I caught a couple fun pics of seattle and cranes while I was out fishing with three of my buds.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_fishing.jpg" alt="june_2020_fishing" title="june_2020_fishing" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_fishing_cranes.jpg" alt="june_2020_fishing_cranes" title="june_2020_fishing_cranes" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2020_fishing_water.jpg" alt="june_2020_fishing_water" title="june_2020_fishing_water" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>After spending March-August alone in Cap Hill, I moved into an Idahoan airbnb with friends in September. Here's a pic going from Clark Fork back to Bonners Ferry after a day of hiking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/sept_2020_idaho_drive.jpg" alt="sept_2020_idaho_drive" title="sept_2020_idaho_drive" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In October, I moved back to Kirkland, WA with the bulk of that group. Here are some pics of the beautiful trees in our neighborhood that fall.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/oct_2020_storms.jpg" alt="oct_2020_storms" title="oct_2020_storms" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/oct_2020_clouds.jpg" alt="oct_2020_clouds" title="oct_2020_clouds" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_room.jpg" alt="nov_2020_room" title="nov_2020_room" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Right near our house was Juanita Beach, and we made good use of the fresh air and scenery while confined to mostly outdoor activities. Here's one of my roommates standing at the dock near sunset.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_ariana_juanita.jpg" alt="nov_2020_ariana_juanita" title="nov_2020_ariana_juanita" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>That same november I drove down to California to spend some time with family over Thanksgiving. Here are a couple pics driving down from Sacramento </p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise.jpg" alt="nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise" title="nov_2020_fuzzy_sunrise" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_sunrise.jpg" alt="nov_2020_sunrise" title="nov_2020_sunrise" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>and one driving back up in Oregon</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/nov_2020_oregon.jpg" alt="nov_2020_oregon" title="nov_2020_oregon" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Which leaves us with our last picture of 2020, a photo from my room showcasing stormy yet sunny skies and some (still all working!) string lights.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/dec_2020_room.jpg" alt="dec_2020_room" title="dec_2020_room" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I don't have too many skyline photos from the first half of 2021 but I did capture some of the snow that covered our neighborhood in February</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/feb_2021_snowy.jpg" alt="feb_2021_snowy" title="feb_2021_snowy" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/feb_2021_snowy_street.jpg" alt="feb_2021_snowy_street" title="feb_2021_snowy_street" width="3024" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Later, in March, someone else took this pic of me walking to the Marymoor climbing wall. I left this one till the very end, not only because chronological order dictates I put it here, but also because it's better than a lot of my own photos. My only solace is knowing that the picture just wouldn't be the same without me in it, and thus it would've been nigh impossible for me to take.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/mar_2021_marymoor.jpg" alt="mar_2021_marymoor" title="mar_2021_marymoor" width="2560" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>In June, my last month in Seattle (this time around), I took a skyline pic in Belltown</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_belltown.jpg" alt="june_2021_belltown" title="june_2021_belltown" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>and I remembered to grab one of the pink and blue sky in Marymoor as well.</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_drivein.jpg" alt="june_2021_drivein" title="june_2021_drivein" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I ended my time in Kirkland by driving out, headed (indirectly) to Virginia. As such, I think it's fitting ending this post with a photo I took headed from Washington to San Francisco, the last time I was in the Pacific Northwest and the first leg of my journey east!</p>
<p><img src="/images/drivesnskies/june_2021_seattle_to_sf.jpg" alt="june_2021_seattle_to_sf" title="june_2021_seattle_to_sf" width="4032" loading="lazy" /></p>]]>

<h2 id="what-s-up">What's up?</h2>
<p>Currently I'm working on developing musical instruments and studying the materialist conception of history full-time. When I'm not doing that, I try my hand at woodworking, electronics, playing music, cooking, and many other short-lived but fondly-remembered hobbies.</p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of moving from Seattle back to Virginia.</p>
<h3 id="professional-experience-mostly-in-seattle-and-nyc">Professional Experience, mostly in Seattle and NYC</h3>
<p>I was last a software developer (aka a <code>networking engineer</code>) at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> working on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/">Azure Traffic Manager</a> in Redmond, WA.</p>
<p>In 2017 and 2018, I spent time interning at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/">Bloomberg, LP</a>. I built software to incorporate open orders in cash blotters for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/">Asset and Investment Manager</a> (buy-side tool suite) during my first year there. My second year, I switched over to sell-side tools as I worked on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/salesperson-dashboard/">Salesperson Dashboard (DASH)</a>; here, I built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange">FIX</a> message sender and simulator for internal development testing, beta production testing, and external sales demonstrations of our application suite workflows. I also won a fun <a href="https://vimeo.com/242652952">overnight puzzle challenge</a> during my time there, s/o Mikey Mike and the Bloomberg Bunch!</p>
<h3 id="education-and-academic-hobbies-back-in-blacksburg">Education and Academic Hobbies, back in Blacksburg</h3>
<p>I got a couple B.Sc.s from <a href="vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> in math and computer science in 2018.</p>
<p>I've spent time helping out at <a href="https://vthacks.com/">VTHacks</a> (PR and organizing for the event) and <a href="https://www.vthunt.com/">VTHunt</a> (making the site for the puzzle hunt).</p>
<p>I was also a member of the <a href="https://icpc.cs.vt.edu/#/">VT Programming Team</a>. We competed in the <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>, training under <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gback/">Dr. Godmar Back</a>. I competed in the <a href="https://mausa17.kattis.com/standings">2017 Mid-Atlantic ICPC Regional</a> on team WorstSort (we finished #7/170). In the <a href="https://mausa18.kattis.com/standings">2018 Mid-Atlantic ICPC Regional</a>, I was a member of the Classy Coders (we finished #11/185). I was also a <a href="https://codecon.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg CodeCon</a> World Finalist in 2019.</p>
<p>In the offseason, I was briefly President of the <a href="https://gobblerconnect.vt.edu/organization/ProgrammingTeam">VT Programming Team Offseason</a>. Along with being the de facto pizza orderer, I gave some lectures on concepts like <a href="http://bit.ly/2sAlomU">Greedy Algorithms</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2G8q1KH">Dynamic Programming</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2nRbnfJ">Backtracking Algorithms</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/2Gg11xX">Sliding Window/Line Sweep Algorithms</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy writing programming problems when I get the opportunity. I've written for <a href="https://icpc.cs.vt.edu/#/hscontest">Virginia Tech's High School Programming Contest</a> a couple times:<br />
<a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/provincesandgold">Provinces and Gold</a> is a fairly trivial problem based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)">Dominion</a><br />
<a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/substitutionmania">Substitution Mania!</a> is a tricky optimization problem - if you do (or don't) solve this one (or any one, really) and want to talk about it, feel free to reach out to me! I love talking about these problems.</p>
<p>I've also written some on the VT <a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/">Practice Site</a>. Feel free to go through <a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/users/aarav">my submissions</a> to collect em all and critique my code, but here are a few I could find:<br />
<a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/286">Lowest Factor Sum</a><br />
<a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/285">Rubber Band</a><br />
<a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/284">Rubber Band (easy version, in case that first one stumps ya)</a><br />
<a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/288">Maximal Substring with N repeated characters</a><br />
<a href="https://pcs.cs.cloud.vt.edu/problems/273">Find the Apple</a>  </p>
<p>I also tutored math and physics (calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, number theory, mechanics) and spent ample time in the Systems Lounge down in the basement of McBryde.</p>
<h3 id="the-formative-years-at-home-in-richmond-va">The Formative Years, at home in Richmond, VA</h3>
<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.gsgis.k12.va.us/">Maggie L. Walker Governor's School</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time in high school dedicated working with my robotics team, the <a href="http://mechtechdragons.com/">Mech Tech Dragons</a>. I was the Team Captain (CEO) my senior year and served as the Build Captain (CTO) my junior year. I won the <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/422/2014">Dean's List Finalist Award</a> during my tenure there and I'm proud to have helped shape the team with some of the most meaningful work I've done.</p>
<p>I worked as a teacher and camp counselor at <a href="https://www.engineeringforkids.com/">Engineering for Kids</a> for a few years. I really enjoy working with kids, and this opportunity was a great chance to develop my ability to communicate and handle overwhelming classroom situations.</p>
<p>I was a research assistant at <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/karlamossi/">Dr. Karla Mossi</a>'s <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~kmmossi/index.htm">Smart Materials Lab</a> at VCU. I helped her and Dr. Ugur Erturun during their research collection and editing phases of their paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359431115003294">Thermoelectric Devices with Rotated and Coaxial Leg Configurations: Numerical Analysis of Performance</a>.</p>]]>
